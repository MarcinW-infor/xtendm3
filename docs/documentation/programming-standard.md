## Naming

### Extensions
Extension names should be a valid Java class name.
There is no restriction on extension names and will run with no error when compiled.  However, when creating extensions, these naming conventions should be followed for readability and maintenance:

__Module__  
`SMS`
`SLS`
`EQM`
`MNT`
`SRV`
`RTM`
`FIC`
`FIM`
`MAN`
`MAI`
`PDM`
`PJM`
`SCP`
`SCE`
`PUR`

__Program Type__  
`IW` Interactive  
`Fnc` Fnc Batch   
`Batch` Batch, Autostart batch  
`MI` MI Batch  

__EXT ID__  
Specification Document ID  

__Description__  
- Description should be in UpperCamelCase  

- Try to keep extension description names simple and descriptive  
- Avoid acronyms of abbreviations unless the word is a common jargon such as CO, DO, MO  

#### Trigger Extensions
`Format: <Module>_<Type>_<EXT ID>_<Description>`  

Type | Program | Extension name
------------ | -------------| -------------  
Interactive | APS450 | FIM_IW_1784_ValidateInvoice  
Fnc Batch| APS450Fnc|FIM_Fnc_1784_ValidateInvoice
Batch| OOLINEPI| SLS_Batch_1784_ValidateCO
MI Batch| MMS100MI| SCE_MI_1784_ValidateDO

#### Utility Extensions
`Format: <Description>Utils`  

DateUtils

#### Transaction Extensions
- EXT9XXMI is reserved for standard extensions and should not be used
- When extending standard API, use same number suffix as standard program  
OIS100MI - EXT100MI  

- If there are same number suffix for standard API that needs to have extensions, use increment in number suffix  
MMS100MI - EXT101MI  

#### Table Extensions
`Format: EXT<XXX>`  
- For standard table extension, use EXT<abbr standard table name>  
OOHEAD - EXTOHD  
OOLINE - EXTOLN  

- For custom table extension, use EXT<XXX> same suffix as extension API  
Table - EXT001  
API - EXT001MI  

### Methods
- Method name should follow Java naming convention for methods  
- Names should be in lowerCamelCase, using no underscores and starting with a letter  
- Only alphanumeric characters should be used. Alphanumeric characters include the letters a-z, either upper case or lower case, and the numerals 0-9  
- Should be simple and descriptive: 
validateDate, 
validateType
